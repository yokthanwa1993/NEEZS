# NEEZS Job App

A lightweight Expo prototype inspired by JobToday that showcases distinct seeker and employer experiences inside a single application.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Launch the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
3. Use the Expo Go app or an emulator to open the project. The bottom tab bar lets you switch between the seeker and employer flows.

## App structure

- `App.js` wires up a bottom tab navigator with seeker and employer stacks.
- `src/screens/SeekerScreen.js` lists curated roles with category filters and rich job cards.
- `src/screens/EmployerScreen.js` highlights active postings and featured applicants for quick triage.
- `src/components` contains small presentational pieces such as job and applicant cards.
- `src/shared/data/mockData.js` houses static sample content that can later be replaced with API data.

Feel free to extend the mock data, connect real APIs, or add authentication to build out a production-ready experience.

## Backend function (optional)

This repo includes a lightweight Express backend under `function/` that uses `firebase-admin` for serverâ€‘side tasks (e.g., role enforcement, protected reads/writes).

Setup:
- Copy env: `cp function/.env.example function/.env` and fill your Firebase service account fields.
- Start API: `cd function && npm i && npm run dev` (listens on `http://localhost:4000`).
- Point the app to it by setting `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in the root `.env` (use your LAN IP or a tunnel URL).

Client flow:
- App signs in with Firebase Auth.
- Fetch ID token via `auth.currentUser.getIdToken()`.
- Call the backend with header `Authorization: Bearer <ID_TOKEN>`.
